            Immediately following the end of Justice League Dark: Apokolips War,
            Constantine sent Flash back in time to create a new Flashpoint, and
            he awakens in the House of Mystery with no memory of how he got
            there. In each room he enters, he is attacked in increasingly cruel
            ways by his loved ones who turn into infernal beings. When he
            manages to escape, the Specter appears and reveals that he put
            Constantine there as a form of imprisonment, although not everything
            he has experienced during his confinement is what it seems. The
            short pays tribute to cult films of the supernatural horror genre
            such as The Door and Blood Pact.
